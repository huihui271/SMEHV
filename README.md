Electric&amp;Hybrid Power Trains

This repository contains the modelica library "Electric and Hybrid Power Train" that is the basis of a webbook chapter, named "Simlified Modelling of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles" available on 
http://omwebbook.openmodelica.org/SMEHV

This repository contains  the files needed to run all the examples of that webBook chapter, as well as a library tutorial very near to that webbook chapter.

The reason for this repository is that it can be updated much faster than the webbook chapter. 
Perodically, updates of thin this repository are transferred int the chapter.
