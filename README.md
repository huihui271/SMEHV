Electric&amp;Hybrid Power Trains

This repository contains the modelica library "Electric and Hybrid Power Train" that is the basis of a webbook chapter, named "Simplified Modelling of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles" available on 
http://omwebbook.openmodelica.org/SMEHV

This repository contains  the files needed to run all the examples of that webBook chapter, as well as a library tutorial which contains basically the same content of it, with cosmetic enhancements and (possibly) future updates. 

This makes this repository a special type of Modelica library: it is oriented to teaching, although models are complete enough for production usage. The content connection to the webBook is underlined by the "wb" initial string of the ".mo" and the "pdf" files.
Description of the usage of the various files of this repository is in section 2.3 of "wbEHPT Tutorial.pdf" .

The main reason for the existence  this repository is that it can be updated much faster than the webbook chapter. 
Perodically, updates made on the files in this repository are transferred in the webbook chapter.
